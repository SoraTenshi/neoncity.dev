## Hello! || こんにちは || Moin!

I am a young Software Developer that has an interest in:
- CTFs (mainly rev & pwn)
- Programming Languages
- Japan / Japanese (as a language)

# []($section.id("dotted-sep"))

My favourite programming languages (in no particular order) currently are:
- Elixir
- Zig
- Odin
- Go
- Rust
- Lisp (Mostly Clojure and Scheme)

# []($section.id("dotted-sep"))

My typical development setup contains: Ghostty, [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), [My own Helix fork](https://github.com/SoraTenshi/helix/tree/new-daily-driver) and in general, everything i use for development can be found in my [NixOS config](https://github.com/SoraTenshi/nixos-config).

This is a personal Website to just write down some of the things i learned throughout the time
being, i also intend to use this to enhance my communication skills.

Criticism / Feedback is generally received by personally, just write an issue [on my GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SoraTenshi/neoncity.dev/issues).
